// After some investigation, the stack issue was narrowed down to `risc0-zkvm`s
// prover. The CPU-based prover runs out of stack space in a parallelized accumulate
// operation. FFI function is `risc0_circuit_rv32im_cpu_accum`, which is called
// indirectly by `risc0-circuit-rv32im` in `src/prove/hal/mod.rs:205`. The stack usage
// in the failing thread is ~384700 bytes.
